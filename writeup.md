## Introduction

**What this is:**  

An encounter agnostic tier list. The rationale behind a sinner's rank will never be based entirely on existing content. First and foremost, the numbers on their rolls will be analyzed in detail to approximate their ability to clash and deal damage, since this ability is universal and critical. Then, notable parts about their kit that compensate or undermine their numbers will be taken into account. Example strategies and experiences will be provided if appropriate, but a sinner's rank will never be chosen primarily based on that.

What this means is, this list will serve as a guide for those who want to make the Limbus Company experience as accessible as possible for themselves. Investing in the units this list recommends will ideally make clearing content as practical as possible. Failing that, it will illustrate the opportunity cost of not having certain units, which in most cases is more acceptable than intuition would suggest.

Please recognize that all tier lists, including this one, are generalizations.

**What this isn't:**
- A mirror dungeon tier list. Animation speeds and performance in undertuned stages play absolutely no role in any of these rankings.
- A story tier list. [Virtually any strategy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9PkdtklMNOv6vDgTHwNvtsLecK0G7GrR) can work for story stages. This means that they generally cannot provide meaningful feedback on a sinner's future viability.
- An autobattle tier list. Knowing how to redirect clashes, cancel enemy actions, pace skill pools and manipulate skill order within a turn is critical for maximizing certain identities.

## Rankings

A cyan square indicates that a unit has a high skill ceiling. They will rely on technical prowess to earn their rank.

A gold square indicates that a unit has a notably good support passive. They may prove their worth when benched, especially for low sinner clears.

A pink square indicates that a unit performs notably well in the context of maximin strategy. They may be an option for Refraction Railway, but require too many resets or too much setup to be practical otherwise. (Shi Ishmael, W Meursault)

**S TIER — STANDARD SETTERS**

Units in this tier tend to directly outperform or invalidate units in lower tiers. Resistances aside, if they can't make a clear work, it's unlikely replacing them will help. Using them almost feels like cheating.

**A TIER — RELIABLE OPTIONS**

These units win clashes that units in lower tiers wouldn't, and can be safely relied upon to hold their own and pull their weight. They feel solid to pilot and most veterans will have no problem appreciating their kits.

**B TIER — MEDIOCRE OPTIONS**

Neither great nor terrible, these units may leave a player idly wishing they were someone else. Everyone in this tier and below will likely never the best choice for anything. That being said, they aren't liabilities.

**C TIER — TECHNICAL OPTIONS**

Specific setups are required to get these sinners to outperform other options. Whatever specialties they have may be made redundant by simply using those who can reliably win clashes.

**D TIER — CHALLENGE OPTIONS**

These units should not be prioritized for fielded combat.

## Rationale


Ironically, sinners in this tier may be more fun to pilot than those in the B tier. For what they lack in numbers they compensate in their own strange ways, and have a higher than average skill ceiling due to being speedy and defensive. That being said, their rolls are still painful to work with, ultimately holding them back.

Emphasis will not be placed on colours— there's no telling what future EGOs hold in store. Furthermore, Refraction Railway 1 has proven that simply taking strong individual identities will easily outperform a team that goes out of its way to align colours for EGO or resonance.
