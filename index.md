# Yet Another Limbus Company Tier List

Written by a stats-obsessed psychopath. Feedback goes to LOWERCASE#0357.

## Introduction

**What this is:**  

An encounter agnostic tier list. The rationale behind a sinner's rank will never be based entirely on existing content. First and foremost, the numbers on their rolls will be analyzed in detail to approximate their ability to clash and deal damage, since this ability is universal and critical. Then, notable parts about their kit that compensate or undermine their numbers will be taken into account. Example strategies and experiences will be provided if appropriate, but a sinner's rank will never be chosen primarily based on that.

What this means is, this list will serve as a guide for those who want to make the Limbus Company experience as accessible as possible for themselves. Investing in the units this list recommends will ideally make clearing content as practical as possible. Failing that, it will illustrate the opportunity cost of not having certain units, which in most cases is more acceptable than intuition would suggest.

Please recognize that all tier lists, including this one, are generalizations.

**What this isn't:**
- A mirror dungeon tier list. Animation speeds and performance in undertuned stages play absolutely no role in any of these rankings.
- A story tier list. [Virtually any strategy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9PkdtklMNOv6vDgTHwNvtsLecK0G7GrR) can work for story stages. This means that they generally cannot provide meaningful feedback on a sinner's future viability.
- An autobattle tier list. Knowing how to redirect clashes, cancel enemy actions, pace skill pools and manipulate skill order within a turn is critical for maximizing certain identities.

## Rankings

A cyan square indicates that a unit has a high skill ceiling. They will rely on technical prowess to earn their rank.

A gold square indicates that a unit has a notably good support passive. They may prove their worth when benched, especially for low-sinner clears.

A pink square indicates that a unit performs notably well in the context of maximin strategies. They may be an option for Refraction Railway, but require too many resets or too much setup to be practical otherwise. (Shi Ishmael, W Meursault)

**S TIER — STANDARD SETTERS**

Units in this tier tend to directly outperform or invalidate units in lower tiers. Resistances aside, if they can't make a clear work, it's unlikely replacing them will help. Using them almost feels like cheating.

**A TIER — RELIABLE OPTIONS**

These units win clashes that units in lower tiers wouldn't, and can be safely relied upon to hold their own and pull their weight. They feel solid to pilot and veterans should have no problem appreciating their kits.

**B TIER — MEDIOCRE OPTIONS**

Neither great nor terrible, these units may leave a player idly wishing they were someone else. That being said, they aren't liabilities.

**C TIER — TECHNICAL OPTIONS**

Specific setups are required to get these sinners to outperform other options. Whatever specialties they have may be made redundant by simply using those who can reliably win clashes.

## Rationale

[An explanation of how to read the roll charts can be found here.](https://github.com/null-machine/limbus-company-clash-tool) 

For a condensed version, the cyan yellow and magenta lines represent a sinner's chance to beat a power at max, zero and minimum sanity. The y-axis represents chance, and the x-axis represents the power of the opposing skill. "agg" means "aggregate", and approximates clashing power by taking an integral of the cyan line. "raw" means "raw damage", and is the summation of the rolls at max sanity. "var" means "variance", and describes how badly the sinner is affected by low sanity.

Emphasis will not be placed on colours— there's no telling what future EGOs hold in store. Furthermore, Refraction Railway 1 has proven that simply taking strong individual identities will outperform a team that goes out of its way to align colours for EGO or resonance. 

Aditionally, damage typing will be ignored in an attempt to maintain future-proofing for unknown encounters.

For the sake of transparency, let it be known that the author is slightly biased towards G Gregor, W Don and L Faust, and slightly biased against R Heath and N Rodion, but everything is still kept as objective as possible.

### S Tier: Don Quixote - W Corp. Cleanup Agent

The weak chart represents Don Quixote with uncharged Rip Space.

![](charts/don_quixote_w_corp.png)
![](charts/don_quixote_w_corp_weak.png)

W Don rewards technical play more than any other identity. At the surface level, playing around S3 tempo allows her to set the standard for what high DPS should look like. Being a charge unit with an evade also lends well to high performance solo or low-sinner clears. S2 additionally inflicts fragile, rewarding tempo control even further. Within individual turns in low-sinner clears, players capable of manipulating skill order will be given agency to charge and fire S3 in the correct order, resulting in good fragile usage, less dead turns and more frequent S3 usage. She has a well-known synergy with Telepole and a lesser known synergy with W Faust's support passive, but relies on neither to earn her rank at the top of the charts. Of course, her S2 and S3 are great at clashing, as befitting an S tier unit.

That being said, she has a few downsides. Her S1 is miserable and can result in dead turns. Her performance may degrade significantly or have increased reliance on Telepole when only given one action a turn. Of course, autobattle plays her pretty poorly, but a reason that trivial will not be factored into her ranking. Other guides may point out that S3's damage is excessive for general content, but having too much damage seems like a good problem to have... and her S2 remains reliable anyways.

### S Tier: Heathcliff - R Corp. 4th Pack Rabbit

The weak chart represents Heathcliff with less than 6 speed.

![](charts/heathcliff_r_corp.png)
![](charts/heathcliff_r_corp_weak.png)

A Quick Suppression at 6+ speed can perform a similar role to a charged Rip Space. Additionally, tech exists to conserve ammo, such as using Bodysack to cycle S1 and S2. Even when out of ammo, his clashing power remains, so he can still reliably neutralize incoming threats with his insane roll numbers. Although he has an evade, soloing is probably not advisable due to his ammo mechanics. On the flip side, this means he won't experience a loss in performance in a full team of sinners.

### S Tier: Ryoshu - R.B. Chef de Cuisine

![](charts/ryoshu_chef.png)

Unlike W Don and R Heath, Chef Ryoshu has no limitations on when she can fire her skills. Her S2 is excellent at clashing, and her S3 has remarkably high damage (but not to the same degree as RS and QS). At the time of writing, there is a possible bug that causes S3 to experience reversed scaling with enemy defense, so it is unknown how it will behave in the future. Regardless, she can be thought of as a consistently strong fighter, as opposed to the highs and lows of W Don and R Heathcliff. Her numbers are definitely there, and she can be expected to clash and deal damage very reliably. Having an evade and no ammo limitations opens up low-sinner strategies as well. The haste on evade win is certainly not unwelcome.

Her kit itself is a bit strange; anti-heal and heal on kill are both rather stage dependent. But, with numbers like that, being a bit dilapidated doesn't define her performance.

It's worth mentioning that her 4th Match Flame passive can theoretically buff her S3, adding tempo to her kit and bringing the raw value up to 50.17 → 68.25, but playing around that is an undertaking most players will not find practical. Maybe it'll show up as a deranged RR tactic...

### S Tier: Hong Lu - Tingtang Gangleader

![](charts/hong_lu_tingtang.png)

The sanity update was so good to TT Hong Lu that the roll analyzer now thinks he's the strongest clasher in the game. Mutilate used to be a dicey shitpost, but it now rolls 30+ with a 95% chance, giving it the highest aggregate in the game (excepting Rip Space, which has charge limitations). His Shank also has the highest aggregate among all S2s, edging out even Ingredient Hunt and Concentrated Fire (but, it's not like either of those would have been likely to lose a clash either). Furthermore, he has no charge or ammo limitations, giving him free reign to abuse that 95% heads to activate all his skill effects and perform extremely well. Ironically, the fact that Mutilate high rolls so high makes him arguably pretty consistent. For other sinners, if their skills don't have enough aggregate, they'll ultimately still rely on the enemy to low roll. Mutilate will not have that problem. In a case where S3 rolling heads won't win a clash, chances are nothing short of high-end egos will outperform it. He gets obligatory bonus points for having an evade, and a relatively strong one at that. It's also worth noting that he has 35 defense, which is considerably higher than other identities with good rolls.

He does have a few downsides though. Besides the trendy miserable S1, he does not tolerate low sanity as well as other sinners. Notably, his combat passive provides a smidge of sanity, which, although undertuned, certainly isn't unwelcome in his heads oriented kit. Additionally, although his kit is cohesive, his damage is not as high as the other units with heavy multicoin skills. Ironically, this makes his overall contributions relatively defensive.

### S Tier: Hong Lu - Kurokumo Wakashu

Due to technical limitations, use the normal chart for evaluating aggregate and the prime chart for evaluating raw damage.

![](charts/hong_lu_kurokumo.png)
![](charts/hong_lu_kurokumo_prime.png)

Cloud cutter.

### S Tier: Faust - The One Who Grips

The prime chart represents Faust with Representation Emitter's +2 power passive.

![](charts/faust_n_corp.png)
![](charts/faust_n_corp_prime.png)

N Faust is almost a twin to Chef Ryoshu— S2 oriented, lots of multicoins, no ammo or charge limitations, a techy evade and solid clashes. She'll fare consistently and reliably with her great numbers. Additionally, her kit is less dilapidated than Chef Ryoshu's. The gaze next turn on S2 adds easily capitalized tempo to her kit, and SP restoration is never unappreciated.

Despite the similarities, Chef Ryoshu has marginally better clashes, and will generally contribute more total damage compared to what N Faust would add with her gaze and nails. That being said, their general differences are not as significant as a level's type weaknesses, so that will serve to distinguish their use cases.

---

### S Tier: Gregor - G Corp. Manager Corporal

![](charts/gregor_g_corp.png)

Contrary to intuition, G Gregor's clashes are virtually identical to Sevens Outis! This is plainly evident when comparing their roll charts and aggregates. The reason for this is, G Gregor has an entire 9 offense level over her, and a difference of 5 levels translates to 1 power in a clash. So even though Sevens Outis has an additional +2 power in every clash due to her skill effects, G Gregor just does that by default. So, in practice, if one of them can win a clash, it's very likely the other can as well. The purpose of this analogy is to emphasize that G Gregor is excellent at clashing. If he fails to win, which is relatively uncommon, his kit provides so much healing that he will generally be able to shrug off lost clashes with little to no consequence. This healing is even more reliable after the sanity update. This utility makes him absurdly reliable, and frankly makes him better at pulling dangerous skills away from core DPS units than most other tanks, especially considering how most other tanks tend to be too slow to pull clashes. Furthermore, deliberately allowing him to get staggered and healing him up during low pressure effectively makes him immortal in later rounds, since he'll effectively have removed his own stagger thresholds. Piloting him feels like giving your team a regenerating frontal shield, allowing heavy damage payloads (e.g. Cloud Cutter) to land without risking a clash. His numbers are great, he suffers no consequences, and piloting him feels like giving your team a huge amount of agency.

The weakest part of his kit is his damage. Of the entire S tier, G Gregor probably has the least to offer in this department. However, his raw damage is still higher than almost all of the units in lower tiers (which probably says more about the rest of S tier than him). In the current damage-oriented meta, an argument could be made that not being all-in damage centric makes him unfavourable, but from experience, the stability he brings to a team allows other DPS units to attack with abandon, and is truly something to behold.

## Author Notes

One thing to keep in mind that strong units do not necessarily correlate with enjoyment. Weaker sinners tend to compensate their lack of power in their own strange ways, and giving them a chance might lead to making some funny memories. Additionally, the game in its current state is easy enough to comfortably clear with just a support unit, so there's no need to worry about accessibility. At the end of the day, Limbus Company is just a game, so have some fun with it!
